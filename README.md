App Tagline: See pictures and rating of sunsets wherever you are!

Link(s) to any other public GitHub repo(s) of your app. If you have one repo for iOS / Android and one for Backend, please link to your backend repo in your iOS / Android README, and your iOS / Android repo in your backend README.

Some screenshots of your app (highlight important features): On Frontend GitHub

A short description of your app (its purpose and features):
Allows users to post pictures of the sunset along with a description, location, and rating out of 10. Users can then see the posts for a particular day and overall rating for any day.

A list of how your app addresses each of the requirements:
Backend:

1 GET route to get posts by day_id

1 GET route to get posts by id

1 POST route to create a post

1 DELETE route to delete a post

There are two tables in the database: a Day table of all the days and a Post table of all the posts. The relationship between them is one to many, with one day relating to many posts.

Has been deployed on Google Cloud at link: http://34.86.124.11/

Anything else you want your grader to know
Note: The link, screenshots, and description will be used for the Hack Challenge website where we will showcase everyoneâ€™s final projects

Backend was submitted separately from frontend and design as these two parts of the team got an extension. They will link their work to our later.
